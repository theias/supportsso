    iClicker Supports <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/learning-tools-interoperability-sso-mechanism">Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)</a> for Single Sign On (SSO).
    </p>

    <p>
    	It appears that iClicker supports LTI as a SSO.
	From the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/learning-tools-interoperability-sso-mechanism">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a> page:
    </p>
    <p>
	<i>Whilst LTIÂ® is not primarily designed as a SSO mechanism,
	some of the data it passes in a launch request are about the
	user. Moreover, LTI works on the basis of a trust relationship
	between the systems which is established by means of a key
	and a secret - much simpler than providing access to a common
	identity server.  In LTI a user is authenticated by a primary
	system (such as an LMS) and then can be passed to another system
	(internal or external) by way of a signed launch message.
	The system receiving this message can verify its authenticity
	by inspecting the signature and then implicitly trust the data
	it carries; there is no need for the user to be authenticated a
	second time or for their identity to be checked against another
	system.  This approach can make LTI a low cost alternative to
	implementing SSO between systems.</i>
